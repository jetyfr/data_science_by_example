# Data Science by Example

This repository is a collection of examples using different data analysis libraries, tools, and techniques.

### [6. Reading CSVs Fast](examples/6_reading_csv/RESULTS.md)

> CSV-parsing: Python, NumPy, Pandas

Reading a CSV file line-by-line is a common problem with a lot of solutions. Which is fastest?

### [5. Finding Outliers](examples/5_outliers/RESULTS.md)

> outlier identification: iPython, SciPy, matplotlib

We'll implement the generalized ESD test to automate the task of finding bad data points.

### [4. Classifying Irises](examples/4_classifying_irisses/RESULTS.md)

> machine learning, classification: iPython, scikit-learn

Learning about supervised and unsupervised classification with `scikit-learn`.

### [3. Parsing GoodReads for the Discworld Series](examples/3_discworld_on_goodreads/RESULTS.md)

> web scraping, data analysis: iPython, requests, BeautifulSoup, Pandas

The Discworld is one of the longest series of books ever, with 41 books. If you haven't read anything in Discworld, where should you start? Let's use Goodreads to learn more.

### [2. Parsing IMDB for the Best Writers & Directors](examples/2_imdb_writers_directors/RESULTS.md)

> web scraping, data analysis: iPython, Pandas

Everyone knows their favorite actors. Only movie buffs know their favorite directors. But no one knows their favorite movie writers. Let's use IMDB to find out more.

### [1. The Philosophy of Wikipedia](examples/1_philosphy_of_wikipedia/RESULTS.md)
