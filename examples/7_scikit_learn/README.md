# An Introduction to SciKit-Learn

This introduction is simply a read-through of the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) [Chapter 5](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.00-machine-learning.html). Though I have not tried to follow the examples precisely and I frequently go off-track, to try out different what-if scenarios or play around with the tools or idea.

I will cover each section in a different Jupyter notebook:

* [Hyperparameters and Model Validation](1_model_validation.ipynb)
* Feature Engineering
* In Depth: Naive Bayes Classification
* In Depth: Linear Regression
* In-Depth: Support Vector Machines
* In-Depth: Decision Trees and Random Forests
* In Depth: Principal Component Analysis
* In-Depth: Manifold Learning
* In Depth: k-Means Clustering
* In Depth: Gaussian Mixture Models
* In-Depth: Kernel Density Estimation
* Application: A Face Detection Pipeline
